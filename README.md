# What is Hebe?
Hebe is the app that allows you to keep track of where you put things.

Simply tell Hebe where you put your stuff, and Hebe will keep track of the location it's stored at, and also the date you stored or moved the item.

Quickly store, locate, and move items by telling Hebe in the command line.
Using the commands are intuitive and fast, perfect for long-term storage.

By telling Hebe "I put my extra work gloves in my shed", Hebe will know that you've stored "Extra work gloves" in "Shed".
Then once you need to find your "Extra work gloves" again, simply ask Hebe "Where are my gloves", and Hebe will bring up all results found related to "gloves".

Hebe helps you maintain a clutter-free environment.
By keeping track of the date you moved and stored items, you'll get reminded if you haven't used an item in a while, to help you get rid of items that you might have forgotten about.

Hebe is especially useful when it comes to items that are rarely used, and often forgotten.

Every storage location you've created is listed out in a clean, expandable list for efficient visualization.
